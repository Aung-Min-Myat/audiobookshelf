# PO-S01 notes (plan-primed one-shot)

Workflow: one instruction; context = CLAUDE.md (rules, checks, pitfalls from the finders) plus the finished finders and the spec and plan in evidence/plans/; no stage gates; Superpowers disabled.
Date: 2026-10-03 (setup). The run date goes in the run-day section.
Branch: Aung-Min-Myat/po-s01 (local clone audiobookshelf-po, no remote)
Commit at start: 2a5d51bf (the Phase 1 tip). Setup commits on top of it: c9f5fe99 (context file, prompt, notes template and baseline) and ba8e1779 (the settings given to the agent).
Claude Code 2.1.286 | Node v24.21.0
Prompt: evidence/plans/PO-S01-prompt.md | Context file: CLAUDE.md | Settings given to the agent: evidence/context-files/PO-S01-settings.local.json
Time limit: 90 minutes from the first message. To stop: Esc, then /usage, then /exit.
Allowed interventions: permission prompts (Yes or No) and the two standard replies in PO-S01-prompt.md. Nothing else. Count them.
Progress measure: first-party .ts files under server/ (3 at start), .js files left (179 at start), build status, tests passing (356 at start), any / @ts-ignore / casts, and compiled files that changed against the Phase 1 build.

How to read the times: every line in "What happened" starts with ~[HH:MM]. Lines marked "exact" took their time from a log timestamp, a file time or Claude's footer. The other times are estimates.

## Definition of success (fixed before the run)

Result = the last green commit (it builds from an empty dist-server and has 356 passing tests). Work that is not committed at the stop is discarded and counted as unfinished. The state at the stop is also reported, even if it is red.
- Pass: the last green commit passes; test/, tsconfig.server.json and package.json are unchanged; no any, @ts-ignore, as any or as unknown as; no converted file has a compiled-output diff of more than about 30 changed lines.
- Good: Pass, with about 10 or more files converted beyond the finders (about 1,500 lines).
- Strong: Pass, with about 5% of the in-scope lines converted (about 2,100 lines).
The thresholds are guesses made before the run.
Denominators from the survey at the start: 179 .js files and 46,182 non-blank lines in server/ outside libs. Out of scope for this experiment: server/migrations/ (15 files, 1,730 lines) and server/utils/htmlEntities.js (2,234 lines). In scope: about 163 files and about 42,200 lines. Report progress against both denominators.
Not checked by this run: whether the server actually starts. package.json shows that start, dev and prod all run node dist-server/index.js, so the compiled output is what runs, but nobody ran the server. Only the build, the 356 tests and the compiled-output comparison are checked.

## Setup state before the run (2026-10-03)

- Isolated clone audiobookshelf-po, made from my Phase 1 branch, with its remote removed: git remote -v prints nothing, so the agent cannot push. Branch Aung-Min-Myat/po-s01, start commit 2a5d51bf, and git user.email in the clone is my GitHub noreply address (checked, True).
- Saved GitHub logins: all removed (see the 01:25 line). The count of "github" entries in the Windows credential list printed 0.
- Baseline: npm ci added 575 packages in 15 s; npm test built with no error TS and gave 356 passing (6s); node v24.21.0.
- Baseline compiled output: a copy of dist-server\server (426 .js files) in my temp folder, outside the repo, made before any agent build. The post-run behaviour check compares the new build against it.
- Settings given to the agent (.claude/settings.local.json, copy saved in evidence/context-files/): acceptEdits mode; the same 7 allow rules as in Phase 1 (git add, commit, diff, mv, status; npm run build:server; npm test), as shown on /permissions; 19 deny rules in the file. /permissions showed 10 deny entries before I added the extra rules, including a PowerShell entry that is not in my file and whose source I have not checked.

## What happened (one line each, format ~[HH:MM])

~[01:17] (exact, the log timestamps inside baseline-test.txt) Baseline rerun with live output: npm ci added 575 packages in 15 s; npm test built with no error TS and gave 356 passing (6s). My first attempt had been interrupted: I pressed Ctrl+C during npm ci and npm test because the output was redirected to a file and the terminal showed nothing, so both files held only the interruption.
~[01:25] Before the run I removed all saved GitHub logins from this machine: four Windows Credential Manager entries (cmdkey could not delete the one whose name contains spaces, so I removed it by hand in Credential Manager) and the gh config file (it held no oauth_token). The environment had no token or GitHub variable. The time of this line is an estimate.
~[01:28] Survey of server/ outside libs (read-only; the time is an estimate): 179 .js files and 46,182 non-blank lines. By folder: utils 12,388 lines (46 files), controllers 8,277 (23), models 6,940 (25), managers 4,757 (18), scanner 3,989 (13), root 2,725 (6), objects 2,578 (18), migrations 1,730 (15), auth 1,141 (3), providers 1,026 (9), routers 631 (3). About 14 small files have no relative require(); together they are about 2,000 lines and they form the start list in CLAUDE.md. I decided to leave out server/migrations/ (MigrationManager copies and loads them by name) and server/utils/htmlEntities.js.
~[01:31] My checks (estimate): the first lines of server/utils/htmlEntities.js are a lookup table of HTML entities (no logic), so it stays out of scope; it alone is 2,234 lines, about 4.8% of the server. package.json: start, dev and prod all run node dist-server/index.js, so the compiled output is what runs.
~[01:33] (exact, Claude's footer) Before the run I tested the setup in a separate 30-second session: I asked "Tell me which rules apply in this repo. Don't change anything." It listed the CLAUDE.md rules and the permissions from settings.local.json, loaded no Superpowers skill, and noticed that CLAUDE.md was still untracked. It pointed out that the settings enforced less than the text: they blocked only git reset --hard (the text bans every reset) and only Edit(test/**), so Write to test/ and edits to tsconfig.server.json, package.json and server/libs were forbidden only by CLAUDE.md. A plain question would not trigger brainstorming, so this does not prove Superpowers is disabled; I check /plugin separately.
~[01:36] I added deny rules for Edit and Write on test/**, tsconfig.server.json, package.json, package-lock.json and server/libs/**, and for git reset * and git clean *, so these are enforced by the settings and not only by the text. In Phase 1 only Edit(test/**) was enforced. The deny list in the file now has 19 entries.
~[01:38] (exact, Claude's footer) Deny test: I asked Claude to create test/zz-deny-check.txt. The Write tool was blocked with "File is in a directory that is denied by your permission settings", and Test-Path afterwards printed False. Claude said that Edit(test/**) alone also blocks Write; my settings contained both Edit(test/**) and Write(test/**), so the test does not show which rule fired. I did not test the rules for tsconfig.server.json, package.json, package-lock.json or server/libs. Claude noted that shell commands writing into protected paths are not covered by these file rules and would only prompt me.

## Run-day record (2026-10-03)

The full record is in evidence/test-results/PO-S01/run-day-record.txt. Key facts: base commit 9f4ff460; weekly bar 33% and session bar 1% at the start; the run happened in the same Claude session as my pre-run checks, not in a fresh session; /model and /permissions were not recorded.

## What happened in the run (2026-10-03, format ~[HH:MM])

~[02:17] (derived, between 02:15 and 02:19) I pasted the prompt in the same session as my pre-run checks. I did not record the clock time. The bounds: my checkpoint at 19 minutes showed 2 commits, so the paste fell between 02:14:52 and 02:19:13, and it was not later than the first commit at 02:19:08.
~[02:19] (exact, git commit time) cd9e93b8: parseNfoMetadata and TrackProgressMonitor.
~[02:34] (exact, git commit time 02:33:52) 0234dfcd: Task and parseFullName, plus server/types/untypedModules.d.ts (uuid ships no types) and found-bugs.md (three upstream bugs in parseFullName, not fixed). The agent had tried Notification.ts first and restored it (its report: this[key] = payload[key] over a union of keys does not type-check without a code change).
~[02:36] (derived, between 02:33:52 and 02:38:13) My checkpoint, 19 minutes after the prompt: 8 .ts files (7 real ones plus server/types/untypedModules.d.ts, which my command counted by mistake), 175 .js files, 2 commits.
~[02:38] (exact, git commit time) ad78f87e: OpenLibrary. It also removed the cast on isbnLookup() in BookFinder.ts.
~[02:48] (exact, git commit time) d88b367b: longTimeout, stringifySequelizeQuery, AudioTrack and hlsPlaylistGenerator (one new boundary cast, in hlsPlaylistGenerator.ts), plus blocked-models-BookAuthor-trial.txt, the compiler errors from a BookAuthor trial that the agent reverted (every Sequelize model's static init clashes with Model.init).
~[02:50] (exact, git commit time 02:49:55) 8d48f5b7: globals and parseUserAgent.
~[02:52] (exact, Claude's footer) The agent ended the run itself, after a turn of 23m 45s, and reported what it converted, what it could not convert and what it could not verify. It said it needed decisions from me to go further (non-null assertions, an index signature, small code changes, or a typing pattern for the Sequelize models).

## Checkpoints

time | .ts files | .js left | commits | build | note
start (about 02:17, derived) | 3 | 179 | 0 | pass (356) | base commit 9f4ff460
about 02:36 (derived) | 8 | 175 | 2 | not checked | 19 minutes after the prompt. My command counted server/types/untypedModules.d.ts, so 7 are real .ts files.
end (02:52, exact footer) | 14 | 168 | 5 | pass (356, my clean build at about 03:07) | counts from the corrected command that leaves out .d.ts files and server/libs

I ran no other checkpoint.

## Result (2026-10-03)

- Stopped at 02:52 (exact, Claude's footer). The agent ended the run itself; my limit was 90 minutes. Reason it gave: most remaining files hit blockers that the rules do not let it work around (every Sequelize model's static init clashes with Model.init; assignment by dynamic key; fields set to null first).
- Time: from the prompt (about 02:15 to 02:19) to 02:52 is about 33 to 37 minutes of wall time (derived), against the agent's reported turn of 23m 45s. The difference of about 10 to 13 minutes is probably my waiting at permission prompts, but I did not measure it.
- /usage at the end (usage-end.txt): Total cost $5.28 (API-equivalent), API time 15m 25s, wall time 1h 28m 28s, 67 requests, 98% of input tokens from cache. claude-opus-5-5: 928 input, 93.1k output, 9.3m cache read, 194.3k cache write. Plan limits at the end: session 5%, week 33%. The Recently denied tab was empty.
- The run alone (end block minus the start block in usage-start.txt, which holds my pre-run checks): about $4.88, 62 requests, about 88.3k output, about 8.9m cache read, about 167.0k cache write, API time about 14m 32s. That is about $0.0054 per converted line (896 lines). The $5.28 includes the checks.
- Files converted: 11 files in 5 commits, about 896 non-blank lines (the agent's count): 2.1% of the about 42,200 in-scope lines and 1.9% of all 46,182 lines. Of the 14 files on my start list, 5 were converted (parseNfoMetadata, parseFullName, TrackProgressMonitor, Task, OpenLibrary); the other 6 conversions were files the agent found itself (longTimeout, stringifySequelizeQuery, AudioTrack, hlsPlaylistGenerator, globals, parseUserAgent). All 6 Sequelize models on the list were blocked; the agent compiled one of them (BookAuthor). Notification was tried and restored; AudioMetaTags and areEquivalent were judged from reading the code, not compiled.
- Speed: about 896 lines in about 33 to 37 minutes of wall time is roughly 1,500 lines per hour, on files the agent picked as the easiest. Phase 1's three conversion tasks ran at about 710 lines per hour, with a spec, a plan and gates, on files the plan chose. The two numbers are not a fair comparison.
- Build and tests at the end: my own clean build and test from an empty dist-server (about 03:07, exact from the mocha log timestamps): 356 passing (5s), no error TS, Debug Failure or failing line. The agent had only built incrementally and ran a non-incremental no-emit check (0 errors).
- The agent's final claim versus the real output: it claimed 356 passing, 0 errors in a full non-incremental check, no banned tokens, nothing changed under test/ or config, and 5 compiled files with 14 changed lines. My own checks agree with all of these. It also listed what it had not verified: the server was never started, no build from an empty dist-server, test coverage, and any types coming from JavaScript modules.
- Prompts I answered: not recorded (the transcript does not show permission prompts). Standard replies used: none appear in the transcript. Auto mode or "don't ask again": not recorded.
- Compaction seen: no compaction message appears in the transcript I copied.
- Against my definition: Pass. Good only on file count (11 files, but 896 lines against about 1,500). Strong not met. Not checked: the server was never started; only 2 of the 11 files have direct tests (the agent's claim); any types coming from untyped JavaScript are not counted.

## Failure-mode checks (2026-10-03, my own commands)

- Tests changed: no. git diff --stat against 9f4ff460 for test, config and server/libs printed nothing.
- Config changed (tsconfig.server.json, package.json): no, same command.
- any / @ts-ignore / as any / as unknown as: none found in the .ts files outside server/libs. 13 casts, the same number as Phase 1: the agent removed the isbnLookup cast in BookFinder.ts and added one in hlsPlaylistGenerator.ts.
- Compiled output against my saved Phase 1 build: 5 files changed, 14 changed lines in total (Task 3/1, OpenLibrary 2/1, hlsPlaylistGenerator 2/1, parseNfoMetadata 1/1, parseUserAgent 1/1), no missing files. BookFinder.js compiled identically although its source lost a cast.
- Rules in CLAUDE.md the agent ignored: none found by my checks. It committed groups of files, which CLAUDE.md allowed; it added server/types/untypedModules.d.ts, which CLAUDE.md did not mention (uuid has no types, and the tsconfig excludes .d.ts files, so it pulled the file in with a reference comment); and it restored failed files with git mv and git restore, as the rules allowed.
